schedrun - RUN v0.1

  shedrun [OPTIONS] [[COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS]]

  where [[COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS]] signify the command you wish to execute.  If 
  you are using pipes or redirects, the command must be enclosed in quotes.  
  You do not specify these if you are also specifying an Application Profile 
  (described below).

  The following are command options to modify the behavior of 'run'.  By 
  default, 'schedrun' will execute your application interactively with no parallel 
  features enabled.  More often than not, this is not what you want.  Why would 
  this be the default then?  Because you need to configure this tool for your
  environment first!

  -p [parallel_configuration] | --parallel[=<parallel_configuration>]
      By itself, this option enables the default Parallel Configuration,
      "$DEFAULT_PAR".  This option is required to run parallel jobs. 

  -n <int> | --num-cpus=<int>
      Specify the number of CPUs required for your parallel job.  Required if 
      specifying -p.

  -c <int> | --num-cpus-per-node=<int>
      Specify the number of CPUs to use per node.  Useful for MPI/OpenMP 
      applications.

  -t <time_val> | --time=<time_val>
      Specify the time required to execute your job.  Default for BATCH jobs 
      is 10 minutes.  <time_val> takes the format <HH...>HH:MM:SS

  -m <memory> | --memreq=<memory>
      Specify the total amount of memory that this job will use.
      <memory> takes the form of e.g. 16G, 0.2G, 256M, etc.

  -a <array_spec> | --array=<array_spec>
      Specify that this job is an array job (which spawns multiple copies of 
      the same job).  Within each copy of the job, the variable SGE_TASK_ID is 
      defined as a value within the range defined by <array_spec>.   
      <array_spec> takes the form of n-m, where n is a positive integer
      denoting the first task and m is a positive integer denoting the last 
      task.

  -f <features> | --feature=<features>
      A comma-separated list of features that should be requested for this job.
      Consult system documentation for list of features and their meaning.

  -M <email_addr> | --mail=<email_addr>
      Send job status updates to the email address defined by <email_addr>

  -N <name> | --name=<name>
      Assign a name for this job.  If this option is not specified, one will be 
      generated.

  -e <env_vars> | --environment=<env_vars>
      A comma-separated list of environment variables and assigned values that 
      will be set during job execution.

  -h | --help     - Display this help page.

  -b | --batch    - This job should run in batch-mode (in the background).

  -i | --inter    - This job should run in interactive-mode (in the foreground).
                    NOTE: If no resources are available, job will not start.
                    This mode is the DEFAULT

  -l | --list     - List available application profiles.

  -d | --debug    - Enable extra output during job run to diagnose problems.

  -D | --devel    - Specify that this job should run in the development queue.
                    30 minute limit applies.

  -v | --verbose  - See what this script is doing.

 Example Usage:

  1. Run "Matlab" in an interactive session:
     
     [user@host ~]$ schedrun matlab

     and run Matlab with more available memory:

     [user@host ~]$ schedrun -m 2G matlab

  2. Run a parallel application with 16 processors that needs 10 hours to 
     complete.  Notify you when complete and submit to the queue:

     [user@host ~]$ schedrun -b -p -n 16 -t 10:00:00 -m myemail@mydomain.com myapp

  3. Run an application from a profile that includes parallel support. In
     this case, we choose ANSYS 12 defined by the module 'apps/ansys/12':
     We see here that the command argument can be a valid executable OR 
     an 'apps' module:

     [user@host ~]$ schedrun -n 4 ansys/12

  4. Run an application from a profile that requires environment options and 
     four processors per node:

     [user@host ~]$ schedrun -n 16 -c 4 -e INPUT_DB=mydb.gdb gromacs/4.0.5

  5. Run an application in parallel that is tuned for a specific processor
     feature:

     [user@host ~]$ schedrun -p -n 32 -f sse4e -t 4:00:00 myapp

 Please log any issues at the project's Github page, 
 http://github.com/brichsmith/schedrun.  

 If reporting an issue with a job, please re-run with the -d flag and 
 attach the job's output.
